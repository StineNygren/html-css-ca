When writing the code for the popup added to cart section I used the code on the site https://codepen.io/imprakash/pen/GgNMXO 
and on the horizontal scroll part at the home page I used the code from https://codeburst.io/how-to-create-horizontal-scrolling-containers-d8069651e9c6 .
 I did some changes to it, but the code was made in the same way.
